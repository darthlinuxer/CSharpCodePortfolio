@* _ViewStart.cshtml link
The _ViewStart.cshtml file contains code that executes after the code in any content page in the 
same folder or any child folders. It provides a convenient location to specify the layout file 
for all content pages that are affected by it, and that is typically what you see in the 
_ViewStart.cshtml file that comes with any Razor Pages (or MVC) template. *@
