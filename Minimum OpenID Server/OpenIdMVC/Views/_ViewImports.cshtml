@* _ViewImports.cshtml link
The purpose of the _ViewImports.cshtml file is to provide a mechanism to make directives available
 to Razor pages globally so that you don't have to add them to pages individually.
The default Razor Pages template includes a _ViewImports.cshtml file in the Pages folder - 
the root folder for Razor pages. All Razor pages in the folder heirarchy will be affected by the 
directives set in the _ViewImports.cshtml file. *@
